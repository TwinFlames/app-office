  desc:   ''The libreoffice/online image is compiled so that there can only be 20 max connections and 10 max open open documents. Those restrictions make the app unusable for many users. Therefore, I have compiled the project with the max connections and max open documents limits set to 100,000, which should be plenty for all but the largest organizations.''
